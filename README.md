The data within the data folder is not included in this repository, it can be added by downloading it from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/data (both training and test set) and adding a subfolder named kaggle, within which all images are without subfolders. 
The final weights of the networks are also not in this github, as its capacity is limited. 
The runner*.py files are the ones that run a certain thing, e.g. nearest neighbour comparison of encodings.
